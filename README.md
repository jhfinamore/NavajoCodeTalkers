# NavajoCodeTalkers
These are two python files that take an english sentence or word and convert it into Navajo. This is similar to how the Navajo Code Talkers would have done it in WW2. 

These two files can be run directly in the command line or in a python IDE. 
Both programs run endlessly until they are terminated manually for the purpose of the demonstration in real life.
